# ME-227-Vehicle-Dynamics-and-Control

This was hands down the best class I have taken at Stanford. The drifting assignment was one of the cooler ones (especially
since we got hands-on experience at LeMans Racing in Fremont as well) so I figured I'd throw it in.
Pole Position contains the project code and report. Our project team consisted of Ryan Lee, Tatiana Mowry, Megan Rowe,
and myself. Miss y'all.
